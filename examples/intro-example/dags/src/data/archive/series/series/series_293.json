It is based on a United Kingdom show titled The Million Pound Hoax, broadcast on Sky One earlier that year.\n\n$25 Million Dollar Hoax consists of three unscripted hour-long episodes in which small-town girl Chrissy Sanford plays a hoax on her family by convincing them she had won a US$25,000,000 lottery prize through the internet, and that it had changed her from a sweet girl into a spend-a-holic. This program is an example of reality television.\n\n$25 Million Dollar Hoax contained guest appearances by Ed McMahon, George Gray, and N*SYNC's Lance Bass.\n\nChrissy successfully pulled off the hoax, which won her and her family over $400,000 in cash and prizes.","popularity":0.628,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6383,"logo_path":"/bQVIn5JphAADvT4hljIMuzgm3sz.png","name":"Reveille Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":59146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hallock Healey Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2004-11-08","episode_count":3,"id":906,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Reality","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
