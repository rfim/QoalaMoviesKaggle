It was based on the 1986 book, Salute Your Shorts: Life at Summer Camp by Steve Slavkin.\n\nThe series, filmed at Franklin Canyon Park and the Griffith Park Boys Camp within Griffith Park in Los Angeles, was set at the summer camp Camp Anawanna. It focuses on teenage campers, their strict and bossy counselor, and the various capers and jocularities they engage in.\n\nThe title comes from a common prank campers play on each other: a group of kids steals a boy's boxer shorts and raise them up a flagpole. Hence, when people see them waving like a flag, other kids would salute them as part of the prank.","popularity":3.472,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":278,"logo_path":null,"name":"Propaganda Films","origin_country":""},{"id":5371,"logo_path":"/7EFsFPaWY5DFn8s9rz2ORHxAw0y.png","name":"Nickelodeon Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1991-07-04","episode_count":13,"id":1284,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/nEh1XHFGV95DBKYrdPDIQ0lUVho.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"1992-06-26","episode_count":13,"id":1283,"name":"season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/wkubTfcWMgYOMIogF1Dsgz9aEqz.jpg","season_number":2}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":8}
