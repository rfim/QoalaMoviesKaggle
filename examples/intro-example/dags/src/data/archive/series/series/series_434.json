It was the primetime news broadcast of Associated Broadcasting Company in the Philippines. It was anchored by Cheri Mercado and Amelyn Veloso. The show was originally first aired in 1962, and went off the air in 1972 due to martial law, and re-aired again in 1992 as a revival and also as an English language newscast. In 2004, when the network reformatted most of its programs, the show became a Filipino language newscast in order to compete with the other networks newscasts.\n\nOn May 10, 2004, the newscast exchanged timeslots with Sentro, the early-evening news program of the network. Mercado became the sole anchor of the program, and the length of the program was reduced to 15 minutes from the former 30.\n\nOn August 8, 2008, the program, together with Sentro aired its final broadcast.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
