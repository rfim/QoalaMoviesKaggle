Launched in 1993 during Canada's 35th general election, the show focuses on Canadian politics, combining news parody, sketch comedy and satirical editorials. Originally featuring Cathy Jones, Rick Mercer, Greg Thomey and Mary Walsh, the series featured satirical sketches of the weekly news and Canadian political events. The show's format is a mock news program, intercut with comic sketches, parody commercials and humorous interviews of public figures. The on-location segments are frequently filmed with slanted camera angles.\n\nIts full name is a parody of This Hour Has Seven Days, a CBC newsmagazine from the 1960s; the \"22 Minutes\" refers to the fact that a half-hour television program in Canada and the U.S. is typically 22 minutes long with eight minutes of commercials.\n\nJones and Walsh had previously worked together on the sketch comedy series CODCO, on which Thomey sometimes appeared as a guest. Mercer had been a notable young writer and performer on his own, touring several successful one-man shows of comedic political commentary.","popularity":5.429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2001-04-01","episode_count":3,"id":167,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"2009-09-28","episode_count":20,"id":166,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":0,"id":70938,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"1995-11-06","episode_count":2,"id":159,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/3EpMdQApD4ild2tguDwrxkPmtb.jpg","season_number":3},{"air_date":"1996-09-30","episode_count":17,"id":160,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/6QbWWDp1sthR0O0NP9tuC53OXXv.jpg","season_number":4},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":0,"id":70937,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":7,"id":162,"name":"season 6","overview":"","poster_path":"/7YiFvAEQuj09qHtyu4rudWrUPyJ.jpg","season_number":6},{"air_date":"1999-10-11","episode_count":10,"id":157,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":"/roBNpKP88xtiqFghNqpRZ1TOqg6.jpg","season_number":7},{"air_date":"2000-10-16","episode_count":13,"id":158,"name":"Season 8","overview":"","poster_path":"/otxu275QfAbixPpxSJPqGGdEhu0.jpg","season_number":8},{"air_date":"2002-03-22","episode_count":4,"id":161,"name":"Season 9","overview":"","poster_path":"/lRWMesM1cggI4AruCa2MP5id8i4.jpg","season_number":9},{"air_date":"2002-10-08","episode_count":21,"id":155,"name":"Season 10","overview":"","poster_path":"/3gHYl4FpzFqJsqtd0uIx6CezZ0q.jpg","season_number":10},{"air_date":"2003-10-10","episode_count":18,"id":156,"name":"Season 11","overview":"","poster_path":"/6YnZaVODNTHyA3yMxsndQADPQ4B.jpg","season_number":11},{"air_date":"2004-09-24","episode_count":11,"id":163,"name":"Season 12","overview":"","poster_path":"/usHU2GtLcRUXaO9mM8LA0MizO2L.jpg","season_number":12},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":0,"id":70939,"name":"Season 13","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":13},{"air_date":"2006-10-03","episode_count":18,"id":164,"name":"Season 14","overview":"","poster_path":"/5Hi8MrWvKEh5iPWNZ2udxOok9dz.jpg","season_number":14},{"air_date":"2007-10-02","episode_count":1,"id":168,"name":"Season 15","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":15},{"air_date":"2008-09-30","episode_count":19,"id":170,"name":"Season 16","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":16},{"air_date":"2009-09-28","episode_count":14,"id":169,"name":"Season 17","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":17},{"air_date":"2010-09-21","episode_count":10,"id":171,"name":"Season 18","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":18},{"air_date":"2011-09-13","episode_count":21,"id":172,"name":"Season 19","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":19},{"air_date":"2012-09-18","episode_count":22,"id":173,"name":"Season 20","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":20},{"air_date":"2013-10-08","episode_count":19,"id":70936,"name":"Season 21","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":21},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":75541,"name":"Season 23","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":23}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":25}
