The series was created by its star, Christopher Titus, Jack Kenny, and Brian Hargrove. This sitcom was based on Christopher's stand-up comedy act, more specifically his one-man show Norman Rockwell is Bleeding, which was based loosely upon his real-life family; lines from Norman Rockwell is Bleeding were spoken by Titus as commentary. Titus plays an outwardly childish adult, who owns a custom car shop. The show follows him and his dimwitted halfbrother Dave, his girlfriend Erin with the \"heart of gold\", his goody-goody friend Tommy, and his arrogantly lewd, bigoted and multiple-divorced father Ken \"Papa\" Titus.","popularity":7.372,"poster_path":"/Ab7WWSBFSYbZVXORydeEaPltG9K.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":257,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"2000-03-20","episode_count":9,"id":256,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/xFoLN7gebhJYbBRharHKc5sjNBY.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"2000-10-03","episode_count":24,"id":255,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/vY89KM4tkQHDjHulZSMm6UWToRq.jpg","season_number":2},{"air_date":"2001-11-14","episode_count":21,"id":254,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/fxJK5nkcF2atVQWEsLcgcfP36v0.jpg","season_number":3}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":21}
