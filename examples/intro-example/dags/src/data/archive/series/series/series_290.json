It premiered as a special on August 19, 1972, then began its run as a regular series on February 2, 1973; its last episode was on May 1, 1981. The ninety-minute program followed the Friday night edition of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\n\nThe show typically featured guest hosts, except for a period from July 1975 through March 1976 when singer Helen Reddy served as the regular host. Wolfman Jack served as the announcer and frequent guest host. The program's theme song, a traditional folk song called \"Midnight Special\", was performed by Johnny Rivers.\n\nThe Midnight Special was noted for featuring musical acts performing live, which was unusual since most television appearances during the era showed performers lip-synching to prerecorded music. The series also occasionally aired vintage footage of older acts. As the program neared the end of its run in the early 1980s, it began to frequently use lip-synched performances rather than live. The program also featured occasional comedic performances such as Richard Pryor and Andy Kaufman.","popularity":1.161,"poster_path":"/3pHSprTU1ccTbgwrw0R1jRa0YHg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60402,"logo_path":null,"name":"Burt Sugarman Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1392,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Broadcasting Company","origin_country":""}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1973-02-02","episode_count":1,"id":70351,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":87769,"name":"Season 8","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":8}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
