He’s young, he’s single, and he’s really just looking for fun and sex, meeting guys mostly on hookup apps, but when the bedroom door closes, he is subjected to the type of questions cis men only feel safe to ask in private.  Jay’s chosen family comes with him on his journey, starting with his primary relationships with cis women: Selena, his gluten-intolerant Angeleno best friend and Darlene, the Bostonian hairdresser/problematic fave who practically raised him and Penis Mascot, the cartoon caped penis who personifies his id.  When he meets Joe, a kind genuine guy who’s really into him, he doesn’t really know how to act and must learn self respect to save any hope for his new relationship.","popularity":1.0,"poster_path":"/hDSXLHoLH1KMBRhvB7iswnhd3W4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Heath&Henshaw","origin_country":""},{"id":71854,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mattioli Productions","origin_country":""}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2020-09-01","episode_count":7,"id":155383,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Planned","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
