This spin-off of the original show was created by Tom Ruegger and premiered on September 10, 1988 and ran for three seasons on ABC and on The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera as a half-hour program, until August 17, 1991\n\nFollowing the show's first season, much of Hanna-Barbera's production staff, including Tom Ruegger, left the studio and helped to revive the Warner Bros. Animation studio, beginning with Tiny Toon Adventures. This was notable for being the last series where Don Messick voiced Scooby-Doo, and one of the few animated series in which someone other than Frank Welker voiced the character of Fred Jones. Messick and Casey Kasem were the only two voice actors from other Scooby-Doo series to reprise their roles in this version, and both received starring credits for their work.","popularity":8.632,"poster_path":"/3psJl6EIAMw90Cy5TxBvtEjvEEu.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1988-09-14","episode_count":8,"id":1222,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"1988-09-10","episode_count":13,"id":1219,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/gjQJ8v5Jg16EIwh4TSlhzhFN2yx.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"1989-09-09","episode_count":8,"id":1221,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/TB1PTvFeOgQzF3E0H7bRWEveG7.jpg","season_number":2},{"air_date":"1990-09-08","episode_count":9,"id":1220,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/O1MMFzbgrOBos6WXbJEc1LOhpB.jpg","season_number":3},{"air_date":"1991-08-03","episode_count":3,"id":142185,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":41}
