It’s a race against time as CIA agent Rex Matheson investigates a global conspiracy. The answers lie within an old, secret British institute. As Rex keeps asking “What is Torchwood?” he’s drawn into a world of adventure, and a threat to change what it means to be human, forever.","poster_path":"/yzG8C6pJ8J8Q2oLaC6xVfjq4hmK.jpg","season_number":4}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":247}
