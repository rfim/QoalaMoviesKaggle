The success of The X-Files on Fox proved there was an audience for science fiction shows, resulting in NBC commissioning this proposed competitor following a pitch from producers Bryce Zabel and Brent Friedman. The series debuted September 21, 1996 on NBC, and was later rerun by the Sci-Fi Channel. Its tagline was \"History as we know it is a lie.\"","popularity":7.343,"poster_path":"/nBNPfdllB1opBX4FWL2w2UkrbHO.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1996-09-21","episode_count":19,"id":534,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/bDWjOIzzYGl2GypPcTOg5iN88eP.jpg","season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":15}
