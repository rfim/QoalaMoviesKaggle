The protagonists were Michael Murray, the Militant tendency-supporting Labour leader of a city council in the North of England and Jim Nelson, the headmaster of a school for disturbed children.\n\nThe series was controversial partly because Murray appeared to be based on Derek Hatton, former Deputy Leader of Liverpool City Council â€” in an interview in the G.B.H. DVD Bleasdale recounts an accidental meeting with Hatton before the series, who indicates that he has caught wind of Bleasdale's intentions but does not mind as long as the actor playing him is \"handsome\".\n\nIn normal parlance, the initials \"GBH\" refer to the criminal charge of grievous bodily harm - however, the actual intent of the letters is that it is supposed to stand for Great British Holiday.","popularity":2.717,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":57869,"logo_path":null,"name":"GBH Films Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":750,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"1991-06-06","episode_count":7,"id":749,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":4}
