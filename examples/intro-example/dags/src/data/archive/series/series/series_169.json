It was created by Norman Lear and produced by Alan Thicke as a spin-off/summer replacement from Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. It was a parody talk show, hosted by Barth Gimble and sidekick/announcer Jerry Hubbard, complete with a stage band, Happy Kyne and His Mirthmakers. Barth was the twin brother of Garth Gimble from Mary Hartman.\n\nLike Mary Hartman, Fernwood 2 Night was set in the fictional town of Fernwood, Ohio. The show satirized real talk shows as well as the sort of fare one might expect from locally-produced, small-town, midwestern American television programming. Well-known actors usually appeared playing characters or a contrivance had to be written for the celebrity to appear as themselves.\n\nAfter one season of Fernwood, the producers revamped the show the following year as America 2-Night. In this second version, Barth and Jerry's show moved to California and was broadcast nationally on the fictional UBS network, whose slogan was \"We put U before the BS\". This change allowed the show to now have well-known actors on the show as themselves.","popularity":4.374,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1977-07-04","episode_count":65,"id":558,"name":"Fernwood 2night season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
