He later moved to the radio anchor of DZIQ. On August 15, 2010, aside from birthday of Mel Tiangco, the new intro of Mel & Joey is unveiled.\n\nTo date, its last episode in the studios was on February 6, 2011. Afterwards, the show has been at a designated venue and that's where the show would take place.\n\nAfter 7 years on air, GMA decided to cancel it for an unknown reason. The show is well-received and has a lot of commercials, so the reason is to give way to a planned talent show that would compete with other rival networks","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
