He is paid huge amounts of money for his views consulted by the government but he's bored and wants adventure so he joins the shadowy organization The Council which controls everything going on in the world. Starring alongside Mayall is Michael Maloney as Brian Albumen, Cnut's faithful servant, and Emily Bruni as Dr. Hannah Awkward who becomes professor of pedantics.\n\nThe series was written by Maurice Gran and Laurence Marks, who give a twist to many of today's global issues.\n\nAlthough much hyped by ITV, who were hoping to repeat the success of Gran and Marks' previous project with Mayall, the successful The New Statesman, the series failed to catch on, and was dropped after one series.","popularity":2.201,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":57873,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alomo Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2002-07-14","episode_count":6,"id":922,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/sDAobDFibTpZ6zUJwzDk99pidQ7.jpg","season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
