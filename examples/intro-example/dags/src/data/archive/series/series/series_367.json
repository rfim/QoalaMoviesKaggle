It focuses on the life of the main character Frank and Casper. The show builds its comedy around quiet everyday situations, social awkwardness, uncomfortable silences and general faux pas.\n\nKlovn shares many concepts with the American sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm by Larry David, notably the main concept of a semi-retired comedian encountering humorous and embarrassing situations, along with his wife, friends and celebrity acquaintances. The show is also held in a pseudo-realistic style, where a first-time viewer might be in doubt of whether or not the show is staged. Even the score is similar. In spite of this, in its closing credits, the show is claimed to be an original idea by Casper Christensen and Frank Hvam.\n\nThe sitcom consists of 60 episodes spread over 6 seasons, each episode lasting 25 minutes. The sixth season, which is said to be the last, aired between 23 February and 27 April 2009.\n\nOn 16 December 2010 Klown, a movie based on the series, with an original plotline, was released.","popularity":8.288,"poster_path":"/62vo6x9oZtsPb1txqzhwFqVjvGx.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":1080,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"2005-02-07","episode_count":10,"id":1073,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/rVIDPuHVOj7zYyMND5Oiob82snl.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"2005-09-12","episode_count":10,"id":1075,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/6ESj9ff81rVQcanl8wBexYdRZib.jpg","season_number":2},{"air_date":"2006-03-06","episode_count":10,"id":1076,"name":"season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/x1do4zyeRNUZ3CSalRDKbh6enxc.jpg","season_number":3},{"air_date":"2006-09-11","episode_count":10,"id":1074,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/b5aBsLP8nplzkUBJQ3FDIQ1ErfA.jpg","season_number":4},{"air_date":"2008-03-03","episode_count":10,"id":1077,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/kTJWCTMZFdMnhi10AZGd4mq6qNG.jpg","season_number":5},{"air_date":"2009-02-23","episode_count":10,"id":1078,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":"/8Yups8JApamtJDhBEYUNF2bVLVl.jpg","season_number":6},{"air_date":"2018-08-13","episode_count":10,"id":107944,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":7}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":8}
