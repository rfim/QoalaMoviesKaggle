The series stars Burt Reynolds as Wood Newton, an ex-professional football player for the Pittsburgh Steelers, who returns to rural Evening Shade, Arkansas to coach a high school football team with a long losing streak. Reynolds personally requested to use the Steelers as his former team because he is a fan.\n\nThe general theme of the show is the appeal of small town life. Episodes ended with a closing narration by Ossie Davis summing up the events of the episode, always closing with \"... in a place called Evening Shade.\" The show's final episode saw the guest appearances of Willie Nelson and Buzz Aldrin as escaped convicts on the run from authorities, the final scene being a spectacular shoot-out reminiscent of the final scene of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\n\nThe opening segment included clips from around Arkansas, including the famous McClard's Bar-be-que, which is situated on Albert Pike Blvd. and South Patterson St. in Hot Springs National Park.","popularity":7.392,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8079,"logo_path":"/d8foOvl2mBHXSbhthurUZF03cPf.png","name":"Mozark Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16970,"logo_path":null,"name":"Burt Reynolds Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":15847,"logo_path":null,"name":"MTM Enterprises","origin_country":""}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1990-09-21","episode_count":24,"id":1143,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"1991-09-16","episode_count":25,"id":1146,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"1992-09-21","episode_count":25,"id":1144,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":"1993-09-20","episode_count":26,"id":1145,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":4}
