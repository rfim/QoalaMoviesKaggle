The major success of SMTV Live has been attributed in equal parts to Ant & Dec's original presenting partnership with Cat Deeley, its use of thinly-veiled comedic innuendo aimed at older viewers, and its broadcast of the Japanese cartoon series Pok√©mon. At the height of its popularity, SMTV Live regularly attracted 2.5 million viewers. Ant & Dec's company Gallowgate currently owns the rights to the show.","popularity":8.826,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":1014,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"1998-08-29","episode_count":65,"id":1015,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"1999-09-04","episode_count":52,"id":1016,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"2000-09-02","episode_count":52,"id":1017,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":"2001-09-01","episode_count":52,"id":1019,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4},{"air_date":"2002-08-31","episode_count":52,"id":1018,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5},{"air_date":"2003-08-30","episode_count":18,"id":1020,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
