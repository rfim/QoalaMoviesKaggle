It is a spin-off of the serial General Hospital\n\nIn the first few years, Port Charles got a reputation for focusing most of its energies on the medical school program, setting more of its main action at Port Charles' General Hospital than was seen on the parent show, General Hospital. As it evolved, it turned its focus to stories with gothic intrigue that included themes such as forbidden love, vampires, and life after death. It also abandoned the basic open-ended writing style used on all other daytime dramas in December 2000, instead creating thirteen-week story arcs. This type of storytelling is a staple of Latin telenovelas. It also allowed the cast, crew, and writing staff to only work six months out of the year.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/DhqYW2PoEodc8a62NOX1krAGMg.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1997-06-01","episode_count":152,"id":458,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"1998-01-02","episode_count":196,"id":454,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"1999-01-06","episode_count":41,"id":457,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":"2000-01-05","episode_count":54,"id":455,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4},{"air_date":"2000-12-04","episode_count":13,"id":456,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5},{"air_date":"2001-03-05","episode_count":24,"id":460,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6},{"air_date":"2001-06-04","episode_count":65,"id":459,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":7},{"air_date":"2001-09-03","episode_count":59,"id":462,"name":"Season 8","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":8},{"air_date":"2001-12-03","episode_count":20,"id":461,"name":"Season 9","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":9},{"air_date":"2002-01-02","episode_count":63,"id":466,"name":"Season 10","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":10},{"air_date":"2002-04-01","episode_count":65,"id":464,"name":"Season 11","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":11},{"air_date":"2002-07-01","episode_count":64,"id":469,"name":"Season 12","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":12},{"air_date":"2002-09-30","episode_count":64,"id":465,"name":"Season 13","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":13},{"air_date":"2002-12-30","episode_count":64,"id":468,"name":"Season 14","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":14},{"air_date":"2003-04-02","episode_count":69,"id":467,"name":"Season 15","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":15},{"air_date":"2003-07-07","episode_count":65,"id":463,"name":"Season 16","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":16}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
