The Outhouse hosts promise to talk about gay matters the way the Sports Caf√© larrikins discuss sport.\n\nGreg Mayor has extensive experience in New Zealand television production. Greg was most recently seen on screen as a social commentator on TV One's Tonight. While Greg has had plenty of on-screen experience, it took some coaxing from the producers of The Outhouse to get him back on screen in a permanent role.\n\nCo-host Amanda Betts has a varied curriculum vitae, including modelling work, appearing in television commercials and career and motivational speaking. For a period, Amanda was the 'face of the 80's'.\n\nCompleting The Outhouse panel is Andy Curtis. Andy immigrated to New Zealand in 1977. He has worked as a waiter and recently completed his degree in 3D furniture design and has had his work exhibited.\n\n22-year-old commentator Ollie Hall has extensive experience in journalism, having edited Express, New Zealand's national gay newspaper.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
