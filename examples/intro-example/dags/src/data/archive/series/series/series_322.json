After the episode was complete, Chrome would conclude Perversions of Science.\n\nMost episodes focused on a part of science fiction such as alien invasion or space/time travel.\n\nThe show featured a mix of established talent and young up-and-comers. \"Panic\", for instance, starred a young Jason Lee and Jamie Kennedy opposite Harvey Korman.\n\nAs of 2011 the series has not been released on DVD in the US. However in 2001 it was released in Japan by Pioneer Entertainment where it has since gone out of print subsequently becoming sought after by collectors.","popularity":1.881,"poster_path":"/nGp8QBLCRiNA00jNCXsV6jioSbY.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1997-06-07","episode_count":10,"id":958,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
