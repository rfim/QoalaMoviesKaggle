While the name is used for all NHL broadcasts on CBC Television, Hockey Night in Canada is primarily associated with its Saturday night NHL broadcasts, a practice originating from Saturday NHL broadcasts that began in 1931 on the CNR Radio network and continued on its successors, and debuting on television beginning in 1952. Initially only airing a single game weekly, the modern incarnation airs a weekly double-header, various segments during the intermissions and between games, and pre and post-game coverage of the night's games.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7puLizM75JD3K11bMcsP6QxxKU1.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
