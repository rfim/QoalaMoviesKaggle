After the show, the truck was driven to the home of the winner. It was shown on Saturday mornings from 15 October 2005 to 8 July 2006 on BBC Two and the CBBC Channel. It was presented by Reggie Yates and Dani Harmer. The format was devised by Joe Mace and Juliet Denison.\n\nAlthough it was targeted at children between the ages of 8 and 12, the frequent references to TV production issues, mixture of characters and bizarre humour won it a small cult following amongst adults.","popularity":1.231,"poster_path":"/rIIXBA2fbJ47Qj3SrsHWmfw0P5q.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2006-04-01","episode_count":15,"id":2328166,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
