It aired occasionally from 1985 to 1992, under the World Wrestling Federation banner on NBC in place of Saturday Night Live.\n\nAt the time of the original airing it was a rare example of professional wrestling being broadcast on an over-the-air commercial television network after the 1950s. It coincided with and contributed to the apogee of the \"second golden age\" of professional wrestling in the United States. In a time when weekly programming consisited primarily of established stars dominating enhancement talent, Saturday Night's Main Event was made up entirely of star vs. star bouts.\n\nAfter leaving NBC in 1991, it aired twice on Fox in 1992 before disappearing for over a decade.\n\nWhen WWE's flagship show, Raw returned to the USA Network in 2005, Saturday Night's Main Event was revived in 2006 as a \"special series\" to air on occasion on NBC as part of a deal between WWE and NBC Universal. The Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand rosters were featured on the show.","popularity":5.685,"poster_path":"/fAVhX85QmROHrEShHf68ZrJM850.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1985-05-10","episode_count":41,"id":1351,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":9}
