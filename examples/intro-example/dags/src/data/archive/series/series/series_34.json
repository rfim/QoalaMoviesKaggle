Centred on the life of eccentric, social-climbing snob Hyacinth Bucket, the sitcom follows her obsessive and determined attempts to impress in middle class society and portray herself as more affluent than she truly is.\n\nThe show stars Patricia Routledge, who received two BAFTA nominations for her performance as Hyacinth. Broadcast between 1990 and 1995 on BBC One, the sitcom spawned five series and 44 episodes—4 of which are Christmas specials. Keeping Up Appearances was a great success in the UK and also captivated a large audience in the US, Canada, and Australia, but production ceased in 1995 when Routledge wanted to move on to other projects. Since its original release, all five series—including Christmas specials—are available on DVD. In 2004, the sitcom was ranked 12th in the countdown of Britain's Best Sitcom. It is regularly repeated worldwide.","popularity":8.37,"poster_path":"/cdZZKNSvNYF4XJeq9l0uCgNWlJp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/16fY7pucCzn7WSOYxOGRHlAayL3.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1991-12-25","episode_count":14,"id":27,"name":"Specials","overview":"Christmas may come but once a year, but for arch-snob Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced Bouquet, if you please), disaster, drama and humiliation – all obstacles on the ladder to social-climbing success – are far more frequent. In these Christmas Specials we see a delightful cruise on the QE2 start in a less-than-delightful muddy field. We see a glorious English Civil War pageant, with Hyacinth as Queen Henrietta Maria, go royally wrong when the cast fails to turn up and her unsavoury relatives step into the breach. And we see that even The Season of Good Will isn’t immune from woe, as a sherry-fuelled Richard, dressed as Santa, brings Hyacinth tidings devoid of any comfort and joy.","poster_path":"/5cs2ny2UwwhASGprpwkcDVmrDwU.jpg","season_number":0},{"air_date":"1990-10-29","episode_count":6,"id":24,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/puQMhtInUtATvyHw6P5QNg6LFfl.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"1991-09-01","episode_count":10,"id":23,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/wqYpm32vFVVNciy0zkXAlc0d6ar.jpg","season_number":2},{"air_date":"1992-09-06","episode_count":7,"id":22,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/aoAUwjVDsjow2D6oZyDIntD46Ex.jpg","season_number":3},{"air_date":"1993-09-05","episode_count":7,"id":26,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/bPUkHRG9AFAxQJqAKpqBwjKhKp0.jpg","season_number":4},{"air_date":"1995-09-03","episode_count":10,"id":25,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/qP2cREyenYIZj8fFfihpGeeRxuJ.jpg","season_number":5}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":61}
