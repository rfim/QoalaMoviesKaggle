An anonymous host, producer Stefan Springman, guides them through lifestyle changes - physical, emotional, and behavioral - to help them improve themselves and ultimately be more \"dateable\".\n\nAs VH1 states on its website, Can't Get a Date \"explores the problems of such people and teaches them the skills to find love in an honest, amusing and unique way\".\n\nThe working title of the program was \"Crushed Out\" and was co-created by Stefan Springman, Toby Barraud & Manny Kivowitz.\n\nThe final original episode of Can't Get A Date aired on June 28, 2006. The series run is available free to watch on the Logo website. It was also licensed exclusively to Netflix as part of an ongoing licensing agreement between the network and the company; it can be watched by Netflix account holders via their website, and an exclusive DVD can be rented through Netflix. It contains only the gay and lesbian episodes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lDYGHy85SjflG7PG9AiSXZ2nXEb.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2006-04-07","episode_count":8,"id":532,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
