His drawings depict the life of Father Nicholas, who lives in a Vatican City parody referred to as \"Popetown\". He is charged with being the handler for the Pope who is a complete nincompoop with the emotional and mental maturity of a four-year-old. Father Nicholas must keep the Pope out of trouble, and make sure the general public does not find out that the Holy Father is a drooling idiot. Other characters include a priest who is a sexual deviant, and a trio of corrupt cardinals who secretly run Popetown and attempt to get rich behind the Pope's back. These and other elements caused the show to be extremely controversial.","popularity":1.884,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/16fY7pucCzn7WSOYxOGRHlAayL3.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":72929,"logo_path":null,"name":"CHX Productions","origin_country":""}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2005-06-08","episode_count":10,"id":429,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/fE8lznnqNeg9DH05R2hy1aE5tA0.jpg","season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
