Prior to moving to Fox News, the show aired on PBS for 15 months, ending on December 2, 2005.\n\nOpening with a newsmaker of the week, Gigot usually interviews a guest for the first half of the program, asking questions related to the writings of the guest or a current event of interest to the guest.\n\nFollowing the guest segment, the program becomes a panel discussion of Wall Street Journal editorial writers giving their opinions on the political, economic, and cultural issues of the current week. The final segment labeled Hits and Misses lets the panelists comment on the best and worst stories or events of the week.\n\nThe program is broadcast Saturdays at 2:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. and Sundays at 6:00 a.m.\n\nThe transcript of each show appears on OpinionJournal.com on the following Monday.\n\nThe political point of view of the panel is primarily libertarian, reflecting the \"free markets and free people\" philosophy of the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jnR5JxzGk6DrhHeNdocK701TyE5.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
