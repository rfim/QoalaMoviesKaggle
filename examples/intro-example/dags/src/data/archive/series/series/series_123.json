It was the first reality TV show to be nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award. Six women at a time work to overcome obstacles and meet personal goals. When it is determined that a woman has met all her goals, she \"graduates\" from the house and is replaced by a new roommate. On the other hand, if it's determined that she's not met her goals, she could be put on probation, or even asked to leave.","popularity":16.199,"poster_path":"/dfoTgMdVKF08Sqp4AeLlMcLaVV7.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2003-09-08","episode_count":195,"id":358,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"2004-09-13","episode_count":40,"id":359,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
