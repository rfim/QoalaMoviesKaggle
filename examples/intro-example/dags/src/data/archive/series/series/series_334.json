The crew have manipulated their luckless leader, Captain Murphy, into submission, and are content to ride the government clock, raking in fat, hazardous-duty paychecks.","popularity":6.649,"poster_path":"/eA4JJfHZ6DdfPd3BCu5qWm99Fl5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90033,"logo_path":null,"name":"70/30 Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":6760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Williams Street","origin_country":"US"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1999-11-30","episode_count":2,"id":986,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/5f4Fe4IrzRTFCQZRjeHMZBA5Khq.jpg","season_number":0},{"air_date":"2000-12-21","episode_count":10,"id":982,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/rOkAugIeAQjTnmL5jsjRfVbZHMV.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"2002-04-07","episode_count":11,"id":983,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/3WObcFVf2hEBtYJaC4xRFVHn6lw.jpg","season_number":2},{"air_date":"2003-05-26","episode_count":12,"id":984,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/bjKBjRZ8rhjIiRDMAWIIpkpWDyV.jpg","season_number":3},{"air_date":"2004-06-20","episode_count":11,"id":985,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/vK72VC4AkF5fRUYpkwTLJKE6Q4k.jpg","season_number":4},{"air_date":"2005-03-06","episode_count":8,"id":987,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/4ibPFlDiSCgtMdsyxvm1cGCHYeK.jpg","season_number":5}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":39}
