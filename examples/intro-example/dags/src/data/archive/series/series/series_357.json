The plot revolves around both the daily lives and the misadventures of a group of monsters living in a castle. Although the emphasis was on humour and the show was marketed as a children's programme but also for family entertainment, the show drew much from the genres of horror and dark fantasy. The show has since become a cult favourite and remains one of the most widely recognised kids' shows of the 1980s. Digital children's channel Pop started rerunning the show in 2010.","popularity":2.168,"poster_path":"/rJPOwRTm5Xm3K2gJNuACPtfzoA0.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":1058,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/p95S1D1OlY7z1WvBRemrRjxOeIY.jpg","season_number":0},{"air_date":"1986-10-06","episode_count":25,"id":1054,"name":"season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/2gYAksOt2piZ7MmbCQxJRLu4l6l.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":15,"id":1055,"name":"season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/lmIFF6FWwz6KIT9MSt31hxfKrre.jpg","season_number":2}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":11}
