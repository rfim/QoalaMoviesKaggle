Debuting on May 6, 2003 as Rome Is Burning, it was originally a weekly show in primetime at 7:00 PM ET on Tuesday nights on ESPN. After a short hiatus in 2004, it returned with a new name, Jim Rome Is Burning, and a late-night Thursday timeslot. In February 2005, JRIB became a daily program airing each afternoon at 4:30 PM in between NFL Live and Around the Horn. After ESPN expanded NFL Live to sixty minutes, JRIB moved to ESPN2 as part of its new afternoon lineup on September 12, 2011. It was produced by Mandt Bros. Productions in association with ESPN Original Entertainment and taped in Los Angeles as opposed to ESPN's Bristol, Connecticut headquarters. This was due to his daily radio commitment.\n\nThe show ended on January 27, 2012 with the announcement that Rome had agreed to a contract with CBS, CBS Sports Network, and Showtime. Outside of some 4:3 non-essential game footage camera angles used in play analysis during NFL Matchup, Rome is Burning was the final program in the ESPN family of networks outside ESPN Classic to be produced in standard definition and never upgraded to high definition.","popularity":2.318,"poster_path":"/6DPIT0Qpm5AHCmxCj4loMQP1ZuX.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2006-03-10","episode_count":1,"id":920,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":"2008-01-02","episode_count":195,"id":921,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
