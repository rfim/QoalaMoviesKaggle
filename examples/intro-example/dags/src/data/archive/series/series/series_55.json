It first aired on CBC Television in 1992 and was syndicated around the world. It is set in the fictional community of Lynx River, a primarily Native-run town depicted as being in the Dehcho Region, Northwest Territories. Most of the characters were Dene. Some non-native characters had important roles: the restaurant/motel owner, the band manager, the nurse and the town's main RCMP officer. The show explored themes of Native poverty, alcoholism, cultural preservation and conflict over land settlements and natural resource exploitation. Originally somewhat light-hearted, it quickly became a more dramatic and ponderous series.","popularity":4.28,"poster_path":"/twsoO8NCTitfW4My9wKz2p5yJou.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1999-03-27","episode_count":5,"id":114103,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"1992-12-03","episode_count":16,"id":104,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"1993-10-07","episode_count":16,"id":106,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"1994-10-06","episode_count":16,"id":105,"name":"season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":"1995-10-12","episode_count":16,"id":107,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4},{"air_date":"1996-10-03","episode_count":13,"id":109,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5},{"air_date":"1997-09-25","episode_count":18,"id":108,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":26}
