Starring Mollie Sugden and Ian Lavender, it was written by Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft, who had also written Are You Being Served?, which had also starred Mollie Sugden. Joke banter was recycled from other series, and outrageously strange props were used. Come Back Mrs Noah was not a success, with some regarding it as one of the worst British sitcoms ever made.","popularity":1.257,"poster_path":"/1DSqGi7J0aCiGARpiWgbphL7vzq.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1977-12-13","episode_count":1,"id":1111,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/1DSqGi7J0aCiGARpiWgbphL7vzq.jpg","season_number":0},{"air_date":"1978-07-17","episode_count":5,"id":1112,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/1DSqGi7J0aCiGARpiWgbphL7vzq.jpg","season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
