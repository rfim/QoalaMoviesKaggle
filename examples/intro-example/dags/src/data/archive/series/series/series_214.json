Chabot and Poudy are very much stuck in the 1980s, an obsession which is evidenced by their hairstyles and clothes. Both live in Poudy's mother's basement, where they spend their time playing air guitar and drinking.\n\nPart of the show is shot in black-and-white in a mock documentary style.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":8,"id":686,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":10,"id":687,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
