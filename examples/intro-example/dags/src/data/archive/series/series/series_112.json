It was shown on UK's Channel 4 from September to October 2001. Each episode focused on specific themes relating to human nature and existentialism, around which Iannucci would weave a series of surreal sketches and monologues.\n\nRecurring themes in the episodes are the superficiality of modern culture, our problems communicating with each other, the mundane nature of working life and feelings of personal inadequacy and social awkwardness. Several characters also make repeat appearances in the shows, including the East End thug, who solves every problem with threats of violence; Hugh, an old man who delivers surreal monologues about what things were like in the old days; and Iannucci's barber, who is full of nonsensical anecdotes.\n\nIannucci has been quoted as saying it is the comedy series he is most proud of making. He told The Metro in April 2007 \"The Armando Iannucci Show [sic] on Channel 4 came out around 9/11, so it was overlooked for good reasons. People had other things on their minds. But that was the closest to me expressing my comic outlook on life.\"","popularity":1.912,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1998-11-02","episode_count":9,"id":338,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"2001-08-30","episode_count":8,"id":337,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/581hqY08ZqTYEpz6JXBH1jsIVR0.jpg","season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":7}
