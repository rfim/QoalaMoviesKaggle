ET. It was hosted by former congressman Joe Scarborough.\n\nScarborough Country made its debut in April 2003. On average, Scarborough Country received approximately 300,000 viewers per night. Frequent on-air contributors to Scarborough Country were Craig Crawford, Pat Buchanan, Brent Bozell, and Tony Perkins.\n\nWhile remaining \"extraordinarily conservative\", Scarborough became more critical of President George W. Bush and some of his policies before it ended in 2007. Scarborough more frequently agreed with traditional conservative Pat Buchanan, who appeared on Scarborough's show nearly every day. Scarborough Country was replaced with Live with Dan Abrams in 2007 when Scarborough left to host Morning Joe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
