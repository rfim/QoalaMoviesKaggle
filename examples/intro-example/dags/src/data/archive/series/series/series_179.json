Declassified reveals the stories behind the previously unseen footage with relentless, fast-cut montage and a rock beat. Declassified fuses modern graphics and editing, story-telling, rock music and expert interviews to bring to light the thrilling and secret tales of our modern era.\n\nThe show's director Kosh, winner of three Grammy Awards, is the former creative director for Apple Records and designer for the Beatles and Eagles.
