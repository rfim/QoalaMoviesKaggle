Weasel, an internationally famous, rather eloquent, highly intelligent and much talented weasel who is adored by everyone, and I.R. Baboon, an ugly and idiotic baboon who is envious about Weasel's success and constantly tries to be better than him. The show premise begins from a humorous take on the classic nursery rhyme \"Pop Goes the Weasel\"; in fact, the series theme song, composed by Bill Fulton, written by Richard Pursel, and sung by April March, is based on the well-known musical version of the rhyme.\n\nI Am Weasel was originally a part of the Cow and Chicken show, often airing as the third of three segments in an episode, after two Cow and Chicken segments. Eventually, I Am Weasel was spun off into its own series, aired in 1999 with reruns airing until April 2006, with both new episodes and the episodes that had aired on Cow and Chicken included in this series, totaling 79 episodes.\n\nToday, the series is labeled a classic of Cartoon Network's late 1990s collection of Cartoon Cartoons. Since April 13, 2012, it is being aired on Cartoon Network, on the block Cartoon Planet. This show also airs on Boomerang, but only airs seasons 1-4 with the Cow and Chicken segments.","popularity":8.617,"poster_path":"/z5e3rc1GMmrZrlXrjiJTvUirN2F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1353,"logo_path":"/yXhCcOFK5Fy3ZBQwhBYx8Zu9ZIw.png","name":"Hanna-Barbera Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1997-07-22","episode_count":13,"id":583,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/y2aixL9cckHECtfIRWPbkrWbhCB.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"1998-01-13","episode_count":13,"id":584,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/ahEY6vSKuV7MKBULiHd7tPh2VTn.jpg","season_number":2},{"air_date":"1998-07-21","episode_count":13,"id":585,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":"1998-11-24","episode_count":13,"id":586,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4},{"air_date":"1999-07-22","episode_count":27,"id":587,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":42}
