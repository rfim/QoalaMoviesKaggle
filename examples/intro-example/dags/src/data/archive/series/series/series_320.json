It originally aired between 2001 and 2006, when it was canceled. It was later revived in 2011, only to be cancelled again on May 13, 2012. After its second cancellation, a two-part special aired in July 2012. The original Dutch version was called Now or Neverland. When Endemol USA and NBC adapted it to the American market in 2001, they changed the name to Fear Factor. The show pits contestants against each other in a variety of stunts for a grand prize, usually of US $50,000. From Seasons One to Five, the contestants were generally three men and three women, all competing for themselves, but in Season Six, the show moved to a permanent format of four teams of two people, each with a pre-existing relationship with one another. The show was hosted by comedian and UFC commentator Joe Rogan, executive produced by Matt Kunitz and David A. Hurwitz and directed by J. Rupert Thompson.","popularity":8.906,"poster_path":"/A9FxroNWtOxiApMPxOHbZUWJoaB.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2001-06-11","episode_count":10,"id":947,"name":"season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/8yXtSY5Nhq9eKfEX3PHUFPbFemI.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"2001-11-27","episode_count":20,"id":949,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/vqZFtXiCuMemJ53iH3jTurjUnrM.jpg","season_number":2},{"air_date":"2002-09-23","episode_count":30,"id":951,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/63EtI0MIl9IKHlh5pDj8KxKr0GR.jpg","season_number":3},{"air_date":"2003-09-22","episode_count":34,"id":950,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/qSeamRgBMNtTqcfy2fPzAWd1CrJ.jpg","season_number":4},{"air_date":"2004-08-30","episode_count":31,"id":948,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/568cKtKBLzjFpRHx1W0TYxCBwha.jpg","season_number":5},{"air_date":"2005-12-06","episode_count":22,"id":946,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":"/edcxM1G0QmcLubVdqGhyCcPdkG6.jpg","season_number":6},{"air_date":"2011-12-12","episode_count":9,"id":952,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":7}],"status":"Ended","type":"Reality","vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":33}
