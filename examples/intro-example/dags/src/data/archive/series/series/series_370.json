In Latin America, it was broadcast by Nickelodeon under the title Los Grafitos. It was also aired in the United States on the Fox Family Channel from 1998 to 1999 as part of the series The Three Friends & Jerry, which was adapted on that channel as an anthology series.\n\nThe show, which originated as a series of 1-minute vignettes on CBS in 1994, is about two children named Stacy and Bradley, their hand-drawn adventures with their friends and family, and their fantasies. Stacy and Bradley, best friends, encounter many problems they must face as they continue to grow up - if it is with school, bullies, friends, and parents. They always come up with imaginative ideas to eliminate these obstacles, such as becoming a superhero, and putting themselves in a different environment where they have no trouble in defeating their enemies.\n\nAccording to Nelvana, it uses the \"advanced computer graphics of \"Boiler Paint,\" virtually convincing us that kids are creating their own animated series.\" The show won the Gemini Award for \"Best Animated Program or Series\" in the spring of 1998, while being nominated once again during the fall of 1998, for the Gemini of the same award.","popularity":1.296,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1996-09-23","episode_count":19,"id":1086,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"1997-11-03","episode_count":19,"id":1087,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"2004-09-16","episode_count":5,"id":1088,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
