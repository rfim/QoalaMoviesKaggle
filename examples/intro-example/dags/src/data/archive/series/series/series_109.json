Each season follows the lives of a young group of students at Solar Blue, a high-performance surf academy where several lucky 16-year-olds are selected for a 12-month-long surfing program on Sydney's northern beaches.\n\nThere are three series in Blue Water High. The first two series were screened in 2005 and 2006 and the producers did not intend to create a third series. However, due to popular demand by fans, they relented and made one more series with only Kate Bell returning in a main role. Series three ended with the closure of Solar Blue, indicating that the show would most likely not continue.","popularity":2.999,"poster_path":"/zDsSVyVT0vRNgkaGhkym273UMqS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110945,"logo_path":null,"name":"Southern Star Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2005-05-11","episode_count":26,"id":318,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/ppZRCS0gRvARf55aqeb3v14S3EL.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"2006-06-28","episode_count":26,"id":319,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/g1UIeSzcBqeF2QD3rdQUbXNOqSF.jpg","season_number":2},{"air_date":"2008-04-03","episode_count":26,"id":320,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6}
