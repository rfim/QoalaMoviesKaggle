Four turtles fall into the sewers and are befriended by Hamato Yoshi a Japanese man sent to New York who was forced to live in the sewers. One day he sees a strange green glow which transforms the four turtles into human-like creatures. Hamato (now Master Splinter) changes into a giant rat from the green glow and teaches the turtles the skills of the ninja as they team up with Channel 6 news reporter April O'Neil to battle against Yoshi's arch enemy Shredder and Krang, an alien warlord from Dimension X.","popularity":32.125,"poster_path":"/9vpWpUNKDbC41dRrsQziKREqp29.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67211,"logo_path":null,"name":"I.D.D.H.","origin_country":""},{"id":62043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Murakami Wolf Swenson","origin_country":""},{"id":41109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fred Wolf Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":30900,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mirage Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":67212,"logo_path":null,"name":"Surge Licensing","origin_country":""},{"id":67213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Playmates Toys","origin_country":""}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2009-10-29","episode_count":17,"id":470,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/qxXb3exgZSq9A5xDi8cgLmDIwYQ.jpg","season_number":0},{"air_date":"1987-09-10","episode_count":5,"id":471,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/mVheaaX2F83sSlfEAKF1fYJSkll.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"1988-10-01","episode_count":13,"id":472,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/orIVLYKtfyfEZsrrBxXiCWTyw7R.jpg","season_number":2},{"air_date":"1989-09-25","episode_count":47,"id":473,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/bxEGkAUXbRlMSyp91TGotwWrezr.jpg","season_number":3},{"air_date":"1990-09-10","episode_count":41,"id":474,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/b6rhzhTJZi5vHwtBGikkJc5KkYZ.jpg","season_number":4},{"air_date":"1991-09-23","episode_count":22,"id":475,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/1RHFtPch9kmv19zh0TZ2s8nTEb.jpg","season_number":5},{"air_date":"1992-09-14","episode_count":16,"id":476,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":"/nimEWDHWoOQ36RZvxEvxvnvytRI.jpg","season_number":6},{"air_date":"1993-09-18","episode_count":27,"id":477,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":"/wo45TTF36WQNSeMKn1CdyOaCX7f.jpg","season_number":7},{"air_date":"1994-09-13","episode_count":8,"id":478,"name":"Season 8","overview":"","poster_path":"/g61gpXIE9OOoYI1IyZPeQ72ugZh.jpg","season_number":8},{"air_date":"1995-09-18","episode_count":8,"id":479,"name":"Season 9","overview":"Lord Dregg rises to villainy to battles the Turtles.","poster_path":"/qsRGfXi1GUtYrmllEVpPnWG0V8g.jpg","season_number":9},{"air_date":"1996-09-16","episode_count":8,"id":480,"name":"Season 10","overview":"","poster_path":"/fnmoymCSsJ3IF1JumRjDECjHzwu.jpg","season_number":10}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":304}
