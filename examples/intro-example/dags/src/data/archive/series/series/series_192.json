It ran for four series and totalled 26 episodes, including a 35 minute pilot episode in 1987.\n\nAs in The Two Ronnies, elaborate wordplay and innuendo were staples of its material. It frequently broke the fourth wall; characters would revert into their real-life actors mid-sketch, or the camera would often pan off set into the studio. In addition, the show was punctuated with non-sequitur vox pops in a similar style to those of Monty Python's Flying Circus, often making irrelevant statements, heavily based on wordplay. Laurie was also seen playing piano and a wide variety of other instruments and singing comical numbers.","popularity":5.106,"poster_path":"/x2BeuxXkbOoiUCyECb0AdUHxw0y.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1987-12-26","episode_count":5,"id":633,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"1989-01-13","episode_count":6,"id":628,"name":"Series 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/uUhQqWEJouK8r40JNIwLVRl7PRx.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"1990-03-09","episode_count":6,"id":626,"name":"Series 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/xl8devElMQ8hkHTIsXtKcRKAfXF.jpg","season_number":2},{"air_date":"1992-01-09","episode_count":6,"id":625,"name":"Series 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/yN5MqwNl0eNuzgfnUK7UMJL3ejy.jpg","season_number":3},{"air_date":"1995-02-12","episode_count":7,"id":627,"name":"Series 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/xOdJNLaLkHi4yAmLmgIvuzCVez7.jpg","season_number":4}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":54}
