The Professor was a scientific detective in the mold of Sherlock Holmes, and the series had a smattering of what would later be called steampunk. In the show, the lead character was known primarily by his initials, Q.E.D; the reference here is that Q.E.D. usually stands for quod erat demonstrandum, a statement signalling the end of a proof. The show aired on the CBS network in the United States, and on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom.","popularity":1.024,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1982-03-23","episode_count":6,"id":893,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":894,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1}
