TNT's basketball broadcasts, which include a weekly doubleheader known as TNT NBA Thursday, the Inside the NBA studio show, as well as playoff coverage, are perhaps that channel's signature programs. TNT began airing NBA games in 1988, and aired games on multiple nights of the week until 2002. In the video game NBA 07, made by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 consoles, graphics for TNT's NBA games is seen when playing an exhibition, playoff, preseason, or seasonal game. A direct copy of TNT's graphics can also be seen on Cartoon Network's weekly basketball program, Run It Back, a program similar to Inside Stuff.\n\nThe NBA on TNT is the network's longest-running program, as well as the current longest-running NBA game coverage program in the league.","popularity":4.654,"poster_path":"/nKQ2dUexTahqjXoWTnltg3loIMX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":678,"logo_path":"/hCImnJW7NK5c5HoEsCFtsleAaKw.png","name":"Turner Network Television","origin_country":"US"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":0,"id":120363,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":45}
