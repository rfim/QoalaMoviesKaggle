The women - butch, femme and everything in between - articulately discuss their lives, experiences and struggles with everyday discrimination, busting the myths that homosexuality is a disease and that gay women are doomed to loneliness.\n\nAmong the interviewees are Esme Langley (speaking outside in woolly hat and coat), founder of the Minorities Research Group, Charlotte Wolff, a psychotherapist and sexologist whose 1971 book Love Between Women offered some of the first serious research into lesbianism, and Doreen Cordell, a social worker with the Albany Trust, a charity providing counselling and support to the LGBT community.","popularity":0.98,"poster_path":"/uoaOOpY0J3JgJH4iRUX31KQM2Sr.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":155414,"name":"1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Pilot","type":"Documentary","vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
