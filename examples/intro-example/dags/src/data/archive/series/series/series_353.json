But after hearing one too many of Jake's lectures about pigeon vengeance, when the mother returns to the balcony and seems to know who did it, Ian becomes more paranoid and fearful than Henry that it has come to get him. Worse, Ian's panic attack threatens a meeting Tess arranged with his favorite author, Terrance Sterling, when the pigeon refuses to go away. Meanwhile, Maddie receives somebody else's package containing an expensive cashmere sweater and likes it so much she doesn't want to give it to its rightful owner, while Henry gets seriously turned on when Tess tells him that she went to school with Terrance's lesbian daughter, Brooke, who had a crush on her.","production_code":"","season_number":1,"show_id":353,"still_path":"/r5yWHVPXnKsagb45g1VCQWLCDRo.jpg","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},"name":"Stark Raving Mad","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"name":"NBC","id":6,"logo_path":"/o3OedEP0f9mfZr33jz2BfXOUK5.png","origin_country":"US"}],"number_of_episodes":22,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Stark Raving Mad","overview":"Stark Raving Mad is an American sitcom that aired from on NBC from 1999 to 2000.
