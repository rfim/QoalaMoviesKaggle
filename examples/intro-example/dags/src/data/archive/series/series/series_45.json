A new character was introduced in the first episode of the series. Also for the first five episodes of this series, the \"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\" becomes \"Stars in a Reasonably Priced Car\", featuring two celebrity guests every week, each one setting an individual laptime. In May 2008, after series producer Andy Wilman held a brainstorming session with the presenters and other production staff, various facts about the upcoming series were released. Wilman confirmed that series 11 would see the presenters, Clarkson, Hammond and May, gain more control over the flow of the show's popular news segment. The series included running jokes appearing in each episode: Clarkson showing an image he claims to have found on \"the Internet\" which is censored for the television broadcast; and, in the news section, May appearing to feign enthusiasm whilst presenting a brief news item about the Dacia Sandero with no further discussion before they move on to the next item.","poster_path":"/o4u2H6RYFRyJQhH7I1H9Ufl7VTV.jpg","season_number":11},{"air_date":"2008-11-02","episode_count":8,"id":64,"name":"Series 12","overview":"The 12th series of Top Gear contained eight episodes, and premiered on 2 November 2008, with the usual presenting team of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, James May and The Stig. Clarkson was injured while filming the series, after crashing a lorry through a brick wall at 56 mph in the first episode's HGV challenge. The running joke regarding the Dacia Sandero continues from series 11, with the alteration that Clarkson is now the one making the announcement with feigned enthusiasm, to utter indifference from May. Each news segment also features one of the hosts wearing something unusual, like slippers or a garishly patterned shirt. The only reference to this is that one of the other hosts will, at some point in the segment, ask if they're wearing it for a bet. The Stig, instead of listening to music during power laps, now listens to morse code. The final episode, the \"Top Gear: Vietnam Special\", aired two weeks after the rest of the series as part of the BBC's Christmas line-up. The series was followed by four \"Best Of Top Gear\" specials, charting the best moments from Series 11 and 12.","poster_path":"/7OHCEOf3uE1rzWrYZExMKHQvv51.jpg","season_number":12},{"air_date":"2009-06-21","episode_count":7,"id":65,"name":"Series 13","overview":"Top Gear returned to BBC Two for a 13th series on 21 June 2009, with the usual presenting team of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, James May and The Stig.

In the clip, the parents of a young boy see the Top Gear crew filming the motorhome challenge. The over-excited responses of the parents were adapted to produce the trailer.
