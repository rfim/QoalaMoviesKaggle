The fourth in a succession of Saturday morning shows, it was the replacement for Going Live!, and took many of its features from it, such as phone-ins, games, comedy, competitions and the showing of cartoons. Once Live & Kicking had become established in series two, it reached its height in popularity during series four, when it was presented by ZoÃ« Ball and Jamie Theakston; their final episode won a BAFTA award. After this the series ratings dropped with the launch of SMTV Live on ITV and was eventually cancelled in 2001.","popularity":2.99,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1993-10-02","episode_count":29,"id":1229,"name":"Live and kicking season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"1994-09-24","episode_count":30,"id":1230,"name":"Live and kicking season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"1995-09-23","episode_count":29,"id":1231,"name":"Live and kicking season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":"1996-09-21","episode_count":30,"id":1232,"name":"Live and kicking season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4},{"air_date":"1997-09-27","episode_count":30,"id":1233,"name":"Live and kicking season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5},{"air_date":"1998-09-26","episode_count":30,"id":1234,"name":"Live and kicking season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6},{"air_date":"1999-09-25","episode_count":30,"id":1235,"name":"Live and kicking season 7","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":7},{"air_date":"2000-10-07","episode_count":48,"id":1228,"name":"Live and kicking season 8","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":8}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
