Donnan coached the legendary Oklahoma Sooner Wishbone Offense, a formation that was perfected by Switzer in 1971 when it shattered the NCAA record for total offense per game and eventually led the Sooners to national championships in 1974 and 1975. Under Donnan, the Wishbone helped the Sooners to impressive 11-1 seasons from 1985â€“1987, including a national championship in 1985. In 1986, the Sooners scored 508 points, which at the time was the second highest point total in school history, trailing only the 1971 NCAA record setting offense.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
